# Pygame Templace

This is my pygame template. It allows for a smooth reactive typing interface, as all keyboard inputs are well defined. Mouse inputs and other standard things like screen size are already defined too.

## Before compiling/releasing
- Ensure you run `pep8 --select=E262,E265` to ensure all comments starting with `#!` (warning comments) have been resolved and removed (or you are happy leaving them unresolved until a later date).
